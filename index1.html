                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.

                        <p>
                            My name’s Wolf, I have an IT business in a small country town roughly three hundred kilometres from Melbourne. I run the business as a sole trader,
                            I have a part-time employee and a casual employee. I’ve been running the business for twenty-five years, I started off in the IT industry from the
                            cabling aspect, doing telephone and network cabling for many years, until my curiosity got the better of me and I got the opportunity to do some
                            work with servers and have since branched out into all sorts of IT industry. The cabling aspect was the most valuable part of my business as we
                            were heading into the new century, convergence was really starting to come in on its own, telephones, faxes, VoIP and IoT were all converging and
                            everything needed to be cabled or run by Wi-Fi. The cabling aspect taught me a lot about how things are interconnected. I work with a small number
                            of core customers that I manage, ranging from manufacturing to retail and the hospitality industry. I also have worked for federal, state, and local
                            governments, in either procuring hardware refreshes on behalf of their IT people. Being so far from Melbourne, a lot of companies and federal/state
                            government agencies don’t usually have the resources to send people out to small country towns, so they usually find someone locally to work for them.
                            Their work is very varied, which takes me into unknown areas that I’m expected to understand all their requirements.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h2">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
                        <p>
                            You need to have an understanding of old and new technology, not every industry is up to the challenge of keeping up to date, some of the strategies in your research and development are to maintain some of the old information as your clients are unable to meet a changing environment. Some clients are unable to keep up with the changes that occur, and so you have to maintain a link to the past with the technology they have. It’s not like you move forward and forget the past, you’re bound by your customers to have a link with old technology. So basically, you are a GP in a country town for the IT industry, but then a requirement comes such as a business upgrading. You suddenly have to become a specialist. You then provide specialist support then go back to general work again. There’s a constant evolution of meeting new things and overcoming them. It’s quite a challenge for an individual to be able to do that. Whereas a larger organisation can have those resources at hand and meet those ever-changing needs. Many times, I have considered just working at a factory and just doing work that is less challenging and dangerous. Dangerous in the sense of your mental health, you are given the keys to the safety of your businesses so there’s a lot of responsibility there if your business fails due to your carelessness. The association and trust with your client are paramount. If there’s a disaster caused by your negligence, your mental health will suffer from it, even if it is caused by other means beyond your control. You’ll look over the scene and try to determine whether it was your fault. It may not have been, it may have just been carelessness, may have been a ransomware attack. The pressure in the IT industry when you’re self-employed is that everything hangs on that. If you’re not good at your work, your business will fail. You are employed by your merits, you’re not like a salesman selling things, but you’re actually selling your services and skills. This applies especially in a small country town, if you’re not good at IT word gets around.

                        <p>
                            Some of the other work I do are for companies and government agencies that require remote work. It generally includes a brief that’s sent to me and I just go out and carry out their instructions, whether it be an NBN installation, a security camera installation/configuration, or a hardware refresh. There’s always something that goes wrong and you need to have the skills to work with your clients and resolve the situation if possible. There’s a lot of skills to be learned, whether it be working with IT help desks overseas. That’s a real challenge to get the message across due to language barriers; you’ll need to use all the skills and tricks you can such as talking with photos. You also need to resolve the situation fast because these big companies don’t want to spend too much time or money on these short jobs that they commission. I prefer to have my loyal customers and go my own way, I’m not really keen on working with contractors. Unfortunately, we’re the soldiers in the trenches, everyone up the top gets their nice fat paycheck and we have to negotiate, and we’re screwed for hourly rates so it’s not a pleasant place to be. In a country town, you need your business to survive so there’s no choice but to take the work.

                        <p>
                            The types of people I interact with are clients from the food industry, wholesalers, manufacturing, local industries such as custom-made logging trailers and load trailers for construction work. It’s really interesting to be a part of a team where I’m ensured that all the IT infrastructure operates successfully, a lot of the machinery is computer controlled, it’s really important to keep everything functioning and have an understanding of how things work because in IT it’s not always just programming, sometimes it involves repairing a plasma cutter and the computer inside that’s failed, you’ve never seen a plasma cutter before nor a customised computer before, so you just got to go in and fix it. While there are spare parts available, sometimes they can’t be sourced and quite often factories can’t afford that downtime. This is where it comes down to your general IT skills and understanding of processors. Another one is a timber merchant, where they process quality flooring, wall paneling and decking. Again, these are more like basic computer-controlled machines, not like your gaming console, these machines control basic repetitive processes. In one instance, one of the controllers failed and the replacement controller had to be built overseas since there weren’t any parts available so there was a possible downturn of four million dollars. And again, this is where your general skills come in, such as knowing what electronic components are and if they are damaged.
                            You learn to keep your good customers; you get rid of your bad customers when you can afford to stand up and pay your bills. Unfortunately, when you start up in business you have no choice, you have to take everything you can get until you get yourself established. I like to spend more and more time with my clients and with the help of some of my colleague’s management tools, it helps me free up some time; they serve a valuable part in my operations now. Also, as I’m quite senior in my life, a handover to my colleague will be quite easy as we’re using all of his tools to manage my clients. It’s always been a concern that if I’m no longer able to look after my clients anymore, what will happen to them if I’m taken ill? Will they be left to the sharks or is there some plan in place? Again, it all comes down to the collegiate groups, you pick up something, you find someone that’s doing similar things and then you start discussing how you can help each other, and you move on.

                        <p>
                        In the early years of doing cabling work, running cables was a no brainer, but it's what the cable does that always intrigued me i.e. “What does it transport?”. In the eighties and nineties, there was no google and your information was very hard to come by, other than libraries and bookstores. In terms of being a self-learner, it’s a really hard path. As the internet started to take shape, internet forums became available. One of my suppliers recommended that I seek out some discussion groups along with my pursuits and that’s where I started to communicate with similar minded people. I found that had I not done that; I would have fallen behind in terms of being able to increase my knowledge. You need to have some sort of ability to connect with people who know more than you do and are on a similar path of self-discovery and a desire for helping out people. Once I found a really good group, which was the small business user group in the late nineties, I never looked back. That evolved into a SMBIT group which is quite large today. Without the association, I would be quite isolated in a country town as I wouldn’t have the knowledge just by searching on my own. When you belong to an association you get far more exposure to cutting edge technology.
                        Quite often in country towns are a few years behind their city counterparts in terms of technology reaching them. You don’t have the ability to interact with the latest technology, because your customers aren’t interested, and you don’t have the finances to be able to buy yourself a 36 terabyte NAS drive and work with the storage and backups. I found by having an association with IT professionals, you make friends in the cyberworld and instances where you’re getting a job and having to walk into an unknown area or breaking something without being fully aware of what you’ve done, you still got this collegiate group of people that you can contact and they’ll help you out of a possible mess you’ve made or give you advice on what you should provide to the customer. If you don’t have that collegiate group you’re really on your own island, you need people that can provide you support in a professional way. I was fortunate enough to meet someone that was providing some IT services in my area and we were both members of the IT professionals organisation. Now we work together, where he has a larger client base, has all the remote management tools and experience in knowing how to improve my services towards my clients. It’s been really positive having that opportunity to know someone that I ordinarily wouldn’t ever meet. I would just be this little person in a country town not understanding any new technology or knowing what to look for. Just by sitting back and reading discussions amongst professionals, occasionally there will be something that’s discussed that’s right up your alley, it’s worth belonging to an organisation just for this reason.

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h2">What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h4>
                        <p>
                        Interactions with my customers is a very personal one, that’s due to just being in a country town. The relationship is sincere, it has to be one hundred percent honest that I provide them with the best knowledge that I have and inform them that I don’t have the leading edge on items, but I can still offer a few pathways to choose from as we’re meeting all the new changes. That happens in all sorts of industries whether it’s the tourist industry, individuals or community groups that I volunteer, so it’s important that you have some stake where you provide your services back into the community for organisations in need of IT services that can’t afford to pay the larger companies.
                        I don’t see myself as a salesperson although IT can sometimes be a perfect opportunity for salespeople to move into. I see myself more as a friend and a provider of knowledge to equip a business to run successfully. What makes me fairly unique is that I come from a background with a number of trades and experiences in quite a number of areas. When I interact with my clients, I’ll often have an experience I can relate to and that takes me down a path of showing an interest in my clients and honesty that I understand what they’re doing in order to provide the correct IT advice for their future development. Whilst I moved into a lot of remote support work for my clients, I still feel it is essential that I make contact with as many people I can, whether it’s the CEO right down to the worker in the factory. I try and maintain contact and friendships inside the business, allowing me to get an idea of whether the company seems to be operating smoothly. Because quite often if that’s not done, you’ll find some worker’s IT equipment not functioning correctly and it’s left unaddressed. By the time you’re made aware of the issue, it’s blown up and caused anxiety amongst a number of people. So that’s why you get friendly with as many staff as you can and treat the situation as if you’re a part of the business and that they’re free to contact you when there’s an issue, unlike a managed service agreement or an impersonalised ticket which my colleague has in place. He has about ten times more clients than I have, he just cannot provide that personal touch. Yes, it’s all part of business as that’s the way he operates, but I didn’t want to go down that path. I just cannot see myself taking more customers and having less time to interact with the shop floor. That’s just how I wanted it, I don’t believe that in order to be a successful business you have to constantly expand and make more profit. There’s a sustainable way of operating an IT business and that’s a part of my belief that I always held; I wouldn’t expect someone to do something that I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself. That can also work the other way round as my customers can see how I operate, I’m happy to not run in this headlong ‘success is by excess’ mentality. They can see that I’m not taking them down a black hole of thousands of dollars each time I have an idea. The idea is to provide them with working technology that’s fit for purpose, not technology that’s not required and is just part of a profit-making operation.

                        <p>
                            Quite often you’re not going to work with modern equipment where everything has spare parts with twenty-four seven productions running smoothly because you have stock of every single fallible item. It just doesn’t happen in the real world ever. People just rely on the infrastructure to work and when it fails, when you take action. Questions like “Well how did this happen?” and “Why didn’t we have a backup or a spare part?” leads to changes in the pattern of how IT is thought of in the industry. In some instances, machinery built thirty to fifty years ago is still present in the industry, that’s where your knowledge has to come in. There’s no retrofitting of some machinery, so often you’ll either have to fix it or replace it totally and that’s a huge investment for the company. For an IT professional, if you have really good general skills, you’ll make yourself valuable in the business sector. In country towns like this word gets around pretty quickly that some have saved a company millions of dollars from a disaster, so it’s a great asset to have.

                        <p>
                            The things I find most challenging in the IT world is balancing family and your personal life with workload demands. That’s always been a difficult thing to do in terms of not knowing when there’s a failure from a managed monitoring system, not knowing when you have to suddenly leave home and have to go on site. There’s also a concern about all the changes in the IT world and threats security. Trying to stay one step ahead of hackers, having to understand the law in terms of cyber breaches. There are all these challenges that are constantly running in the background, whether it be working on your ability to try and find time to shut everything out or have some personal space is almost impossible. There’s no way out of this system because you can’t control what happens in cyberspace, it’s moving and you’ve got to move with it, there’s very little breathing space. The other challenge is running a business and getting your invoices out to stay afloat. You need to also have in mind how you want your business to evolve and ensure you are successful in keeping your clients functioning with the right balance of IT equipment. You also need to look at your own strengths and weaknesses and watch out for threats that might come upon you, whether it’s your health or a fire breaks out. You also need to have a contingency and backup plan to ensure you’ve prepared something for yourself.

                        <h4 class="h2">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
                        <p>
                            My clients are so varied, I really haven’t got one example that fits. All I can do is talk about one client that would give you an insight into the challenges I had to meet. It was a local steel merchant around ten years ago who was a part of a strong Christian community and initially needed some IT support. Their IT knowledge was very limited, they were very wary of the potential influence technology could impact on their community. There was a point where they had to move a paper-based operation into an electronic operation. The challenge there was to gain their trust, respect their beliefs and ensure that I would protect them as best I could from outside world influences and ensure that they were protected from the online world that they were connecting to. That meant finding a suitable software program that would manage their accounting and manufacturing, and research what was available gave good support and had similar values that I had in terms of respecting this religious group and also work closely with the owners in customising the program to suit their needs. These people only recently used mobile phones, so it was a real challenge to get them up to speed in terms of being able to operate a business in an electronic form away from ledgers. Over the years, they’ve gained an understanding of IT architecture, such as servers, switches, networking, and are now rolling out security camera systems for their organisation, even to the ever-changing threat from the cyberworld and having to take them through the ten years of evolving technology. They’ve adapted quite well and that’s basically where I’ve learned a lot of my skills in being able to follow a client through from the start like that. It requires a whole range of patience and slow steps with a long-term vision. Most other clients didn’t have that setback, so working with this client really needed some thinking outside the box on how you’re going to take a client into the digital world in a safe and respectful way so that they can be successful in a world that is all changing electronically.

            <h2 >Cyber Security :-</h2>
            <p>
                Cyber-attacks are known to happen every 39 seconds by an unknown hacker around the world according to a Clark school study at the University of Maryland. Since hackers are focused on attacking computers with internet access, there is a need to protect electronic systems, networks, computers, mobile devices, programs and mainly data from these malicious attacks performed by them. This is where the need of Cyber Security is required, as it is known as the practice of defending the devices that have internet access from such hacks. A strong cybersecurity system has multiple layers of protection spread across computers, devices, networks and programs. Cybercriminals can deploy a variety of attacks against individual victims or businesses which includes getting access, making changes or deleting sensitive and confidential data which in-turn interferes with business processes. In-order to prevent this, Cyber security can be achieved via three different components in an infrastructure which includes Information Technology security - protects the data when it's stored or while transferring the data through a network enabling IT security to protect both digital and physical data from the intruders, Cyber security - considered to be a subset of IT security which protects digital data on user's networks, computers, and devices from unauthorised access and prevents destruction to take place, Network security - also known as computer security which is a subset of cyber security that uses hardware and software to protect any data that is sent via one user's computer and other devices to the network. Network security also acts as a guard against data being changed or stolen by cybercriminals. There are different types of cyber threats including Social Engineering - way of manipulating people psychologically and forcing them into perform malicious activities or forcing to give away information, APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) - break through a network anonymously and staying for a long period of time, Malware - designing a specific software to gain access or damage a computer without the knowledge of the owner, that can be protected with these cyber security methods. Other methods of cyber security include Application security, Cloud security, Data loss prevention, End-user education, critical infrastructure security etc. 
            </p>
            <b>The state of cyber security 2020 :</b>
            <p>The cybersecurity skills gap has been plaguing enterprises for years, but despite garnering much discussion and media coverage, little progress is being made. On top of that challenge, cyberattacks continue to increase and are often underreported.</p>
            <b>Some of the latest cyber security methods includes :-</b>
            <br><br>
            <p><b>Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) -</b>that helps in tackling MiM attacks which cracked traditional encryptions and attacked the intermediate nodes. This innovation helps in splitting a message into numerous parts which is then encrypted and is routed into several different protocols on independent paths which leaves the hacker scrambling in-order to find the data that rolls in dynamically optimum paths as they whip through data centres, the cloud etc.</p>
            
            <p><b>Smart Grid Technologies -</b>this technology uses a range of new security standards and measures such as padlock - which is a gateway that establishes encrypted communication between the central systems and the field devices, The Watchdog - performs a deep inspection on data packets for the control system</p>
            
            <p><b>SAML and the Cloud -</b>this technology helps in encompassing an encryption with SAML and detects any intrusions in-order to regain control of corporate traffic. By doing this, the data available in the cloud is corralled and firms will be signalled by the alert system if any issues persist like unexpected logins, suspicious activities, etc.

            <b>Future of Cyber security:</b><br><br>
            <p><b>1. Artificial Intelligence (AI): </b>AI is used to crunch data, automate complex tasks, and make faster decisions than a human. Since more enterprises are dependant on machine learning, hackers will definitely target on AI systems for which the cybersecurity developers will be forced to develop cybersecurity software techniques to detect any corruption attacks that would take place on AI for which the developers of cybersecurity will themselves use AI to address any vulnerabilities and issues with regards to security before they can be taken advantage of, and will repel cyberattacks once it has begun. For this to happen, the developers in particular, will have to embed AI in user interfaces to warn the users about websites that might provide potential risks or any security choices that have been poorly chosen. The Artificial Intelligence technology may also be used in-order to create a simulated network attack which helps in revealing any weak points so they can be solved.
            </p>
            <p><b>2. Cyber-warfare: </b>Cyber-warfare is where one nation tries to embed viruses in the computer systems of another nation that might become a way in which wars will be fought all around the world. Cybersecurity will have to find ways to make key pieces of infrastructure, for those which would make appealing targets during a cyberwar, more flexible to digital intrusions by adding multiple layers of security to traffic systems.  </p>
            <p><b>3. </b>Improvising on cybersecurity talents and developing talented cybersecurity developers will become essential as it will be expensive for organisations to hire a security analyst and the need will become desperate due to improvement in technology especially after emergence of 5G network. Thus, the organisations will try to train with ethical hacking courses such as Cybrary which enables IT professionals to become white hat hackers. etc...which in-turns increase the job opportunities for cybersecurity students.</p>
            <b>Possible changes due to technological improvements that defines the next 10 years of global cybersecurity are:</b><br><br>
            <p><b>1. 5G network and infrastructure convergence: </b>This technology will pose a most challenging issue for the cybersecurity landscape. a 5G network will impact the threat landscape as it potentially moves cybercrime from being an invisible financial driven issue to one where serious physical damage that might occur at a 5G pace as the network provides instant access to any attacker to vulnerable networks. 
            </p>
            <p><b>2.Artificial Intelligence: </b> Though AI is an important component that helps the world to build immunity from attacks, it poses various new challenges to cybersecurity as any technical developments in AI will be quickly seized upon and will be exploited by the cybercriminals as they use AI for generating new attack cycles that are designed to target high which will create greatest impact in new ways that had never been experienced by the industries before.  </p>
            <p><b>3.Biometrics: </b>Biometric authentication requires high volumes of information about an individual including their voices, faces, and even the slightest details of movement and behavioural traits in next-generations which drives the cybercriminals to target and hack those data. </p>
            <p>According to the <b>figure 4 </b> below, the victims who are affected by cybercrime, especially people of age group above 60 will be impacted by the changes stated above.

            <b>Cybersecurity in our (Me and my family) daily life:</b>
            <p>Personally, I feel that Cybersecurity is important in our day to day life as it is the main component that helps in securing the data that me and my family members come across in our day-to-day life, be it a security information such as our credit/debit card details used for online shopping, our personal information such as our identity that includes names, home address, phone number, health information, or our financial information etc that are stored in internet which requires security in-order to prevent enemies or other hackers to gain access to our confidential information. If the hackers get access to our personal information, the chances of them leaking it on the internet will increase leading to unnecessary frustrations within us or any individual around the world unless they wish to have their details leaked on purpose. Thus, cybersecurity is essential for every individual.</p>
            <h2 >Robots :-</h2>
            <b>What does Robot do?</b><br><br>
            <p>Robots can replace or assist human beings to complete all kinds of work. Any boring, dangerous, poisonous, and harmful work can be performed by robots. So far, except for widely used in manufacturing, technology of robots also in resource exploration and development, disaster relief, medical services, family entertainment, military, aerospace, and other fields. The trends in robotics over the next few years will focus on the following direction: safer, more accessible, and more intelligent.</p>
            <p>In the field of manufacturing industry, there are already a large number of robots involved in the production line, such as the automobile manufacturing industry. With the continuous development of the Internet, intelligent agents will enter the vast kinds of industrial production in an all-round way. Combined with the Internet of things, big data and other technologies, robots will assume more job responsibilities in the future.</p>
            <p>The use of robots and artificial intelligence technology in the field of education is a relatively obvious trend. Robots and artificial intelligence technology can solve many problems faced by traditional education, such as the acquisition of knowledge, teaching students according to their aptitude and learning assistance. With the continuous development of these technologies, educational robots will gradually enter classrooms and families in the future.
            </p>
            <p>With the continuous development of Internet of Things technology, a large number of robots in the field of smart home will enter the home in the future, creating a more comfortable living environment for people. The intelligent agent will provide different services according to the requirements of different scenarios, such as cleaning services, security services and other contents.
            </p>
            <p>In the field of medicine and health, through the combination of artificial intelligence, computer simulation, sensors and communication and mobile technology into medical work, the robots can better help medical workers to solve problems. There are several types of robotics in this area: telemedicine robots, nursing and rehabilitation robots, smart prosthetics and organs robots, minimally invasive surgical robots, and micro robots with special functions (also known as soft robots). These techniques can well reduce the risk of surgery and perform refined tasks to reduce the pressure of medical demands.

            <p>There are several leading technologies in robotics today:</p>
            <p><b>Soft robot -- Flexible robot technology.</b></p>
            <p>Soft robotics technology refers to the development, design and manufacture of robots using flexible materials. Flexible materials can change their shape arbitrarily in a large range and have a wide application prospect in pipeline fault inspection, medical diagnosis and detection.</p>
            <p><b>Liquid metal control technology.</b></p>
            <p>Currently, scientists in the UK have found that liquid metal can be controlled through programming. Liquid metal control technology refers to a technology that can accurately control the appearance characteristics and motion state of liquid metal materials by controlling the electromagnetic field external environment, which can be used in intelligent manufacturing, disaster rescue and other fields.
            </p>
            <p><b>Biological signals can control the robot - electro myogenic control technology</b></p>
            <p>Electro myoelectric control technology uses the surface electro myoelectric signal of human upper limbs to control the robot arm, which is widely used in remote control, medical rehabilitation, and other fields.
               For Example: A children's robot call iCub is developed by the Italian Institute of Technology.
                </p>
            <p><b>Robot haptic technology</b></p>
            <p>Robotic haptic technology refers to a new tactile sensor based on electrical and particle haptic technology, which can make robots more sensitive to the shape, texture and hardness of objects, and ultimately competent for a series of complex work such as medical treatment and exploration.
                For Example: Researchers at Cornell University have developed a robotic hand whose soft touch resembles that of a human.
                </p>
            <p><b>Conversational intelligent interaction technology</b></p>
            <p>The robot developed by using conversational intelligence interactive technology can not only understand the user's questions and give accurate answers, but also actively guide the robot to complete the conversation in the case of incomplete information. Apple's new conversational interactive technology will move away from Siri's question-and-answer mode and even initiate the conversation</p>
            <p><b>What is the likely impact of robots?</b></p>
            <p><b>1) The impact of robots on employment: </b>Robots will provide more job opportunities. The development of robots will improve labor productivity and product quality, create more social wealth, and inevitably provide more employment opportunities.
                On another hand, the development of robots may also threaten the employment of some people. The development of robots will lead to the replacement of some workers who are working on simple manual work , which will threaten the survival of human beings. Robots can be used in different fields, therefore, they will replace some people's jobs, leading to the increase of people's unemployment.
            </p>
            <p><b>2) Robots can improve efficiency in today's society: </b>The application of robots can reduce the workload of human beings and solve some difficult problems that cannot be solved by human beings. For example, Ali's urban brain can optimize the time allocation at intersections, improve traffic efficiency and make busy cities more intelligent.</p>
            <p><b>3) The development of robots facilitates innovation: </b>Deployment and application of the enterprises of the robot system to reduce jobs of the operating low-skilled work, but at the same time to create new high technology content, return lucrative new jobs, such as the job of being responsible for robotics system maintenance and system programming, these new jobs not only make the value of skilled people be fully reflected, but also these people can get a higher wage rate of return.</p>
            <p><b>4) The development of robots facilitates human life: </b>Robots are more convenient for people's lives. Nowadays, robots have been very common in our life, such as intelligent sweeping robots, companion robots, family companion robots, etc., making human life more intelligent and convenient.</p>
            <p><b>How will robots affect me?</b></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, robots have already appeared in our lives everywhere. I have a sweeping robot, a smart home robot with AI technology, and various computers. My family and I are no longer wasting time on certain housework, these intelligent robots are helping me and my family to free up from time-consuming housework, so that we can have more time to do other meaningful things.
            </p>
            <p>As a university student, when I am facing the future career of mine, it's necessary to consider which industries robots will largely replace human labor and reduce employment opportunities. At the same time, in daily study and work, learning how to use and integrate robots into them appropriately can greatly improve efficiency. For example, when I'm driving, I can use the artificial intelligence on my phone to help me respond to messages, and when I am at home,  I can turn on the stereo and play the songs I want to listen to without manual operation through the smart home robot.</p>
            <p>The development of robots has more or less influenced my life in various aspects and robot technology will only expand its influence in the future. Therefore, learning information technology, learning robot technology and making correct use of them can provide a better life for myself.</p>
            <h2 >Clouds, services, servers:-</h2>
            <b>What does it do?</b><br><br>
            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services which includes from applications to storages and processing power over the internet to offer faster and flexible resources. Cloud computing includes servers, storage, databases, networking and software. It allows for data processing to be done on a privately-owned cloud or a third-party server. This creates maximum speed and reliability. Cloud computing works by offering the businesses to hire anything from application to storages from a cloud service provider instead of buying it. The main benefit of it is that the firms can avoid the upfront cost of buying the services as it is expensive to own, and the firm can also avoid the maintenance cost of it. Other benefits of cloud computing are ease of installation and scalability. This way it grows with your needs.
            </p>
            <p>Cloud computing offers three most common types of cloud services. They are: </p>
            <p><b>1) Software as a service (SaaS) –</b>Packed Software OS & Application Stack Server Storage Network</p>
            <p><b>2) Platform as a service (PaaS) –</b>OS & Application Stack Server Storage Network</p>
            <p><b>3) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) –</b> Server Storage Network</p>
            
            <p>The above services depend on the requirement of a user and they can be used individually or with the combination of others. SaaS provides various software to the user which can be hired. Whereas, PaaS provides a platform for users where they can host, implement, test or run an application. However, IaaS provides a virtualized platform where the user can create a virtual machine monitor or hypervisor. Furthermore, the user can develop and install their own operating systems, software and applications.
            </p>
            <p>A cloud server is a virtual server running in a cloud computing environment. It is built, hosted and delivered via a cloud computing platform via the online interface, and can be accessed remotely. They are also known as virtual servers. The main features of cloud servers are that it is cheap compared to actual servers, and it can be easily expandable as it depends on the users and it is much more secure than the physical server.
            </p>
            <p>Cloud storage and computing are becoming part of our life day by day. One of the biggest examples is Dropbox, Gmail and Facebook. Dropbox is the clear leader in streamlined cloud storage allowing users to access files on any device through its application or website with up to 1 terabyte of free storage. Similarly, Gmail which is a Google’s email service provides unlimited storage on the cloud. It changed the way people communicate nowadays. Gmail has become the market leader in free email services with more than a billion users across the globe.  Additionally, Facebook stores an unlimited amount of information, images, and videos on your profile. They can then be easily accessed on multiple devices.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing will continue to grow in the future and provide many benefits. As everything is becoming digital day by day so it will become an essential necessity of our lives. As the world is moving forward towards Artificial intelligence, cloud computing will support emerging technologies and help them adapt to different platforms and devices such as mobile and home appliances. The future of cloud computing is bright and very promising.</p>
            <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b></p>
            <p>The organizations require huge amounts and different types of software and hardware to run and they require a lot of experts to install, check and update the software. With the use of cloud computing the company can get rid of those problems as these practices were extremely problematic and expensive. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, as software and platforms are managed by the cloud provider, thus helping users achieve more important business goals and in turn bringing faster innovation and flexible resources to the user.
            </p>
            <p>Cloud computing has changed the way people used to work. It has also changed the way people used to interact with each other. With the help of YouTube and Facebook an event can be reached to any corner of the world.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing has replaced many IT jobs instead of eliminating them. As the world is moving toward technology development day by day, in the next 5-10 years cloud computing will continue to migrate into It positions. The positions which are most affected by cloud computing are system and database administrator as it remotely centralized networks.</p>
            <p>As some of the IT jobs are predicted to be reduced in future whereas some of the jobs related to cloud computing will increase in demand such as cloud engineer, security analyst.  </p>
            <p><b>How will this affect you?</b></p>
            <p> With the current covid-19 restriction in place it has already affected me as all of my studies are online. Which is only possible because of cloud computing. From the delivery of the lecture to the submission of assignments everything is possible with the help of cloud-based software. Not only in studies cloud computing played the crucial role for businesses and governments to continue operating in the current time of crisis.
            </p>
            <p>As a student, it is important to have a backup and easily accessible software which can be used from multiple devices. It also helps to communicate with fellow students or with the groups to reach the goals. As all of us are studying in the IT field I think in future cloud computing will generate many employment opportunities which will benefit all of us.</p>
            <p>Similarly, cloud computing will bring similar benefits for my family like cost saving, security and flexibility. Additionally, collaborative work with friends and colleagues would be revolutionised. Cloud computing increases the efficiency of collaborative works and makes it a simple process. When working in teams, team members can view and share information easily and securely across a cloud-based platform. A great example of such Cloud service Is the platform GitHub, which was in-fact used to produce this project.
            </p>
            <h2 >Blockchain :-</h2>
            <b>What does it do?</b><br><br>
            <p>The Blockchain is the latest and prospective technology in the current economy. This technology can help to solve various kinds of problems in the industrial area, such as security, transparency, trust, and reliability of data processing.A blockchain is a structure of scattered data that is copied and shared among the members of a network. Each block within the chain carries a list of transactions and a hash to the previous block.Blockchains are copied across a peer-to-peer network, the data they have is very hard to corrupt or extinguish. With a blockchain in place, applications that previously run only through a trusted intermediary, now can function in a decentralized fashion, without a central authority, and attain the similar functionality with the same amount of certainty.  Blockchain enables trust less networks, as the parties can transact even, they do not trust each other.The consensus mechanism is an important feature of a blockchain as it makes sure that all participants of a distributed ledger are on the same page and enables the network to keep running even if few members are failing. The most used consensus mechanism is the Proof-Of-Work protocol used by the first-ever cryptocurrency, bitcoin.</p>
            <p>A digital currency created from code to use as a method of exchange is known as Cryptocurrency. Traditional banking and Government systems have no function in it. Blockchain allows to operate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority by spreading its operations across a network of computers. By using this, risks are going to be reduced and processing and transaction fees will be eliminated. The heavy use of cryptography is a main characteristic of blockchain networks which brings authoritativeness behind all the interactions in the network.
                The technology is still innovative, but its potential is vast. Lots of research and development ideas are in practical tests.
                </p>
            <p>In the next three years, four blockchain trends can be seen:</p>
            <p><b>1) Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</b>An NFT is a token on the Ethereum blockchain that carries unique metadata that separates it from other tokens. NFT’s can be used to store much more complex and individual-specific information, while currency is fungible and can be easily transferred.
            </p>
            <p><b>2) Security tokens</b>Security tokens are cryptographic, programmable securities that function as an asset that can be used to take actions. Security tokens can pay interest, dividends, or invest in other assets or tokens, along with other functions.</p>
            <p><b>3) Tokenized assets</b>Over the next three years, Traditional lack of liquidity in assets will be overcome by new forms of liquidity as security tokens, such as real estate or art.
            </p>
            <p><b>4) Self-sovereign identity</b>As cyberattacks continue to multiply, new forms of identity verification will come over the scene to protect user’s information. Self-sovereign identity will allow users to keep a single digital identity across various platforms while choosing the information they want to share. This type of interaction would significantly transform the current digital marketplace that has converted personal data into a commodity.</p>
            <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b></p>
            <p>Blockchain technology allows new ways of organizing economic activities, reduces costs and time related with intermediaries, and improves the trust in an ecosystem of actors.
            </p>
            <p>Blockchain has the potential to change almost all industries out there. More efficient and prosperous world can be created using this technology where people can connect with each other without the need for mediators. For example, a company can use a permissioned network to make an effective system.
            </p>
            <p>Following are prominent industries and people that will be slated to be renovated by blockchain technology soon.</p>
            <p><b>1) The Banking Industry</b>This technology can solve a number of significant problems which are faced by the current banking industry. Currently banks store money for customers and handle the transaction of that money. Blockchain fundamentally has a secure system that will provide permanent records of the millions of transactions that take place in the banking industry each day.
            </p>
            <p><b>2) The Real Estate Industry</b>Anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows how much paperwork is involved in a real estate transaction. This technology can completely change the current problems that all these documents cause.
                By using this, all the documents and transaction records will be stored securely with measurably less cost and work.
                </p>
            <p><b>3) The Healthcare Industry</b>The healthcare industry has needed a significant disruption when it comes to sharing and storing records and medical data. The possibility for fraud, error, and lost records has created distrust between consumers and healthcare providers.
            </p>
            <p><b>4) The Legal Industry</b>This technology is ready to disrupt some areas of the legal industry by being able to store and verify documents and data. For example, litigation dealing with concerns over wills of the deceased or any other documents can be removed.</p>
            <p><b>How will this affect you?</b></p>
            <p>Blockchain will affect me in many ways like:</p>
            <p><b>1) Banking and Payments: </b>There will be more security and proof for fraud in transactions as this technology makes copies of data stored in it and cannot be changed.
            </p>
            <p><b>2) Cybersecurity: </b>Due to this technology, It will be more difficult to hack or infect systems with viruses. Therefore, there will be less stress and more privacy for me as well as for everyone.</p>
            <p><b>3) Voting: </b>Using blockchain in the Voting system will increase privacy and validity of voters and secure the voting process.</p>
            <p><b>4) Property Authentication: </b>Blockchain will keep all records safe and prevent land/property frauds and will make easy to access those records.
            </p>

            <p><b>Blockchain comes with not only positive but negative effects too.</b></p>
            <p>So, Me and my friend/family must face difficulty in:</p>
            <p><b>1) Decrease in speed: </b>As this technology holds many data so it will delay in search engine speed as it must go through all data from different corners on the globe.</p>
            <p><b>2) Network security: </b>As blockchain is not a vast distributed computing system, so mining can not be provided network security.</p>
            <p><b>3) Long term storage: </b>As blockchain entries do not remain forever or can be said as not immutable.</p>
            <p><b>4) Indestructible: </b>Once a record is uploaded in blockchain, then it becomes very hard to delete it later if one wants to.</p>

            <h2 class="ph2">Overview :-</h2>
            <div class ="pp">
                <p>
                    The project idea is to create a ‘fitness’ application based on Australia for mobile devices that excels with a combination of sports, food and blog.
                    <Br> <b class="ppb">Sports -</b> The idea is to bring out a healthy and traditional way of being fit for the users for which the application consist of information
                    such as availability of the nearby grounds / players according to the user’s preferred location for them to engage in several sports
                    and also consist of various exercises to be followed.<Br> <b class="ppb">Food - </b>In this part consists various recipes to make at home, different diet plans,
                    and has an interesting option for the users to choose from the displayed food options which is awarded as healthy and tasty recipes and connects them to the
                    respective restaurants unlike other fitness application and also allow the users to make orders with the restaurant which will be kept prepared for the users
                    to take-away or the users can directly refer to the restaurant and visit them in person to dine-in directly by easing up the process for those people who tends
                    to hesitate to cook at home sometimes and still wants to keep up with the healthy meal plan, which would serve as a motivation and as well as help the users to
                    adopt a healthy life-style.<Br> <b class="ppb"> Blog - </b>This serves the main purpose of making the users want to use our
                    application, by maintaining a page for users to share their experience on using our application and how helpful it was, putting
                    up motivational videos, and also provides a local chat box facility for users to talk or share their perspectives to other users
                    which might help them realise that they are not alone in their weight-loss journey or in their difficult times.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Doing regular exercise is essential for everyone under normal circumstances as it helps people live a longer, healthier and a happy life.
                        Although, it is these times like covid-19 makes it not possible for people at any age considering that they workout almost everyday or
                        even barely, who might even find it difficult to follow a proper diet plan due to the frustration, depression or even because of the time
                        they spend mostly at home in-order to stop the spread of covid-19 making it easy to forget the daily routine and leading to stress-eat,
                        that can be caused because of the lockdown implemented with concern to the pandemic. The government of Australia suggests that it is
                        important to stay active in-order to reduce the risk of health conditions like stroke and heart disease, to control gaining more weight,
                        to reduce stress and anxiety caused by this pandemic, and to improve sleep.
                        This application not only provides benefit during the normal times by helping in boosting up the immune system which might be of a great
                        help to an individual to help prepare their body to fight against any virus leading them to fall sick, but also during such difficult
                        times like covid-19 where one doesn’t want to go to gym, health clubs or fitness centres physically but just use our application instead
                        which gives them the strength to be kept motivated. One of the other main reasons to implement a fitness application is the statistics
                        below showing the projected growth of users using fitness applications from 2017 to 2022 which is to be increased from 62.7 million to 87.4 million users.

                <p>
                    The online training service is an implementation of a virtual video session with a specified coach for users looking
                    for training assistance, similar to video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. Coaches can then
                    provide feedback, perform demonstrations, motivate, and provide advice to the user during their routine, as they
                    would in person. Furthermore, users will be able to set appointments with trainers, with options to choose from
                    such as: Available times for coaches, the type of sport they are participating in or which workout routine they
                    are following, the specific virtual coach they want to work with and also choosing to keep in touch with their coaches via the chat feature.

                <p>GitHub is one software/tool that our group has used a lot as it allows the team the ability of distribution version control and source code management functionality. Whenever a modification or a change in a code is required, we can all manage to make changes through GitHub as it allows multiple people to work on a same file. GitHub is mainly used for programming aspects of our project which is a website. We will work together to complete tasks on to GitHub before uploading them onto our website.</p>

                <p>Google Docs is an online word processor that helps the group to work together as a team. Most of us already used this tool and we are quite familiar with it, so we decided to use this for research and to complete our assignment. </p>

                                What I imagine some of my fellow members were more than a little confident at the prospect of doing this assignment, I was also very positive about it. This is because each group member has different skills, and which helped all of us at some point during the assignment. All of us are good listeners and because of it everyone can better express themselves and their ideas, and allows me to develop my skills which will be vital in my future career: the ability to talk to people, obtain their attention, and establish a rapport. As such, I resolved to make sure that I put all my effort into it. However, my one major concern was that it was a group assignment, while organisational behaviour theory tells us that groups working together can achieve more than individuals working separately'; this depends on the compatibility of the team. As such, my biggest concern was that our team would not work well together, and our work may suffer as a result but while going through it everything was going great and realised it is just an assumption. In my part of coding GitHub was very useful as I can easily change my work via GitHub Desktop from changes made by fellow members. As I will commit my work and they can see it.

                                I think everyone in my group are very cooperative and I am glad that I met such nice people in this subject. Each member is dedicated towards this subject and help each other in this assignment. Everyone was on time during our group meeting apart from one or two occasion, but they watched the recording and completed their tasks which was also divided equally among all the team members. The things which I feel group can really work on is improving the communication as I noticed some of the team member are shy to talk but surprisingly the way everyone work was very professional.This assignment has demonstrated that a team is more than the sum of its component parts. Crucial to what we did was assessing and recognising our strengths and bringing them together to create something more powerful that any of us individually.  I think working in this group will help me to build required skill and confidence to achieve my ideal job.

                                I find my group to be very co-operative and confident in whatever we do. Every individual of our group uses their own strengths, capabilities, and express talent in a way that the tasks assigned for each of us are aimed to be perfectly completed by managing the given time and by delegating the activities extremely well among us. Our group tends to value other's choice and allows us to express other's point of view on any aspect. Everyone in our group has good listening skills which is a very important aspect to become a good team player for every individuals among the group, but some of us are still learning on how to communicate effectively and also be a good team player as we all have our own difficulties and also coming from a diverse background can be a barrier as it takes time to get comfortable with each other. I think our group is adjustable and doing well considering the fact that all of us have different taste and preferences of choices and also from different parts of the world with total different experience and knowledge which is also a benefit for our group as a whole as we get a chance to learn and gain knowledge based on other's experience.

                                From my point of view,it is so nice to meet such good teammates in this course! Each member is dedicated to this group assignment. To start out, time management does well in the whole process, for example, each week our group schedules two meetings and both of them went well.For what things could be improved, I think communication has some tiny issues when we are having a meeting.However, I think the biggest problem comes from myself, because this is my first time to go abroad and I need more time to get adapted to the language environment where people speak English fluently. What surprises me most was that our group is doing so well in terms of html and css, especially the model made by fellow members, which is extremely fantastic. The way to study IT for me is fairly tough, when I was doing the part of Industry data, I feel like my clumsy brain could not contain so much complicated knowledge.

                                For what was doing well, the group was active in organizing meetings and delegating the works of the assignment. Each of the members are willing to indicate what they are good at and work on the section they are familiar with. For what could be improved, I was being an introvert during the meeting which I wasn’t being positive to contribute my thoughts and being a part of delegation of work. Also, the meeting time of the group was usually arranged within 5:30 to 7:30pm which I normally cook my dinner at this period of time, and I was too shy to talk about this issue with my group. For what was surprising, although the group was working on the project together for the first time, everyone was able to enter the flow state very well. What’s more, when I was doing the report on industry data and read some burning glass data for the IT industry, I surprisingly found that some of the skills that I used to think were not that popular, come out they are ranking high in the reality. I learned that it is important for a group to divide the job appropriately for a team to work together and the good delegation of our work by my team members was allowing us to complete our jobs in a good manner.

                                Personally, I’ve had a positive experience working with my group. From what I observed, each member was capable of working in a team environment online, despite the restrictions in place due to COVID-19 preventing us from meeting in person. This was largely facilitated through Microsoft Teams, where we would agree on a specific time to meet via video link and discuss the necessary tasks needed to be completed by each individual member. I found that all members of the group were cooperative and diligent in their work, there weren’t any major disagreements with the allocation of the tasks or the direction of the project idea. On some occasions, there might have been some members who have missed a meeting or haven’t responded to messages, but eventually they followed through with the work that was set out. Our team has a diverse range of skills, while some of us are confident in coding and web design, others excelled in writing descriptive responses for the questions in the assignment. This allows us to utilise our strengths, by delegating tasks to members that match their skillset.

                        In order to carry out our assignment activities effectively and efficiently, the main aspects which went well among our group was: Delegation of work, time-management, and cooperation. Through using Microsoft Teams, each meeting would have an agenda where we would read over the assignment specification and understand what work was needed to be completed. In our team, we divided our work into subsections where some members would focus on specific tasks, e.g. designing the website, rewriting the document, finalising the documents for submission, etc. Regarding time management, our team was consistent in working from start to finish, there weren’t any instances of last-minute rushed work, as we set due dates for each section prior to the actual due date of submission. Lastly, cooperation was another key strength of our group. There were no cases of disagreement or arguments over the work set out for each member, we were all content on completing the work assigned to us.

                        The main aspect needing improvement was our communication skills. Some members in our group don’t excel in public speaking and had a bit of trouble conveying their progress on the assignment. As our group members come from diverse backgrounds, language barriers may contribute to this. However as a whole, we believe we can overcome this problem together in our future assignments and work towards addressing our common goal of delivering work to a high standard.

                        The main thing that surprised our group was the amount of dedication that each and every individual of our group willing to contribute in order to meet our timeline and devising feasible and achievable ideas for our project idea. Another aspect was that we met requirements for the rubric by meticulously reading through it, ensuring that all parts of the assignment were completed well.
