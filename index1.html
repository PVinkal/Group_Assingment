                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.

                            My name’s Wolf, I have an IT business in a small country town roughly three hundred kilometres from Melbourne. I run the business as a sole trader,
                            I have a part-time employee and a casual employee. I’ve been running the business for twenty-five years, I started off in the IT industry from the
                            cabling aspect, doing telephone and network cabling for many years, until my curiosity got the better of me and I got the opportunity to do some
                            work with servers and have since branched out into all sorts of IT industry. The cabling aspect was the most valuable part of my business as we
                            were heading into the new century, convergence was really starting to come in on its own, telephones, faxes, VoIP and IoT were all converging and
                            everything needed to be cabled or run by Wi-Fi. The cabling aspect taught me a lot about how things are interconnected. I work with a small number
                            of core customers that I manage, ranging from manufacturing to retail and the hospitality industry. I also have worked for federal, state, and local
                            governments, in either procuring hardware refreshes on behalf of their IT people. Being so far from Melbourne, a lot of companies and federal/state
                            government agencies don’t usually have the resources to send people out to small country towns, so they usually find someone locally to work for them.
                            Their work is very varied, which takes me into unknown areas that I’m expected to understand all their requirements.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h2">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
                        <p>
                            You need to have an understanding of old and new technology, not every industry is up to the challenge of keeping up to date, some of the strategies in your research and development are to maintain some of the old information as your clients are unable to meet a changing environment. Some clients are unable to keep up with the changes that occur, and so you have to maintain a link to the past with the technology they have. It’s not like you move forward and forget the past, you’re bound by your customers to have a link with old technology. So basically, you are a GP in a country town for the IT industry, but then a requirement comes such as a business upgrading. You suddenly have to become a specialist. You then provide specialist support then go back to general work again. There’s a constant evolution of meeting new things and overcoming them. It’s quite a challenge for an individual to be able to do that. Whereas a larger organisation can have those resources at hand and meet those ever-changing needs. Many times, I have considered just working at a factory and just doing work that is less challenging and dangerous. Dangerous in the sense of your mental health, you are given the keys to the safety of your businesses so there’s a lot of responsibility there if your business fails due to your carelessness. The association and trust with your client are paramount. If there’s a disaster caused by your negligence, your mental health will suffer from it, even if it is caused by other means beyond your control. You’ll look over the scene and try to determine whether it was your fault. It may not have been, it may have just been carelessness, may have been a ransomware attack. The pressure in the IT industry when you’re self-employed is that everything hangs on that. If you’re not good at your work, your business will fail. You are employed by your merits, you’re not like a salesman selling things, but you’re actually selling your services and skills. This applies especially in a small country town, if you’re not good at IT word gets around.

                        <p>
                            Some of the other work I do are for companies and government agencies that require remote work. It generally includes a brief that’s sent to me and I just go out and carry out their instructions, whether it be an NBN installation, a security camera installation/configuration, or a hardware refresh. There’s always something that goes wrong and you need to have the skills to work with your clients and resolve the situation if possible. There’s a lot of skills to be learned, whether it be working with IT help desks overseas. That’s a real challenge to get the message across due to language barriers; you’ll need to use all the skills and tricks you can such as talking with photos. You also need to resolve the situation fast because these big companies don’t want to spend too much time or money on these short jobs that they commission. I prefer to have my loyal customers and go my own way, I’m not really keen on working with contractors. Unfortunately, we’re the soldiers in the trenches, everyone up the top gets their nice fat paycheck and we have to negotiate, and we’re screwed for hourly rates so it’s not a pleasant place to be. In a country town, you need your business to survive so there’s no choice but to take the work.

                        <p>
                            The types of people I interact with are clients from the food industry, wholesalers, manufacturing, local industries such as custom-made logging trailers and load trailers for construction work. It’s really interesting to be a part of a team where I’m ensured that all the IT infrastructure operates successfully, a lot of the machinery is computer controlled, it’s really important to keep everything functioning and have an understanding of how things work because in IT it’s not always just programming, sometimes it involves repairing a plasma cutter and the computer inside that’s failed, you’ve never seen a plasma cutter before nor a customised computer before, so you just got to go in and fix it. While there are spare parts available, sometimes they can’t be sourced and quite often factories can’t afford that downtime. This is where it comes down to your general IT skills and understanding of processors. Another one is a timber merchant, where they process quality flooring, wall paneling and decking. Again, these are more like basic computer-controlled machines, not like your gaming console, these machines control basic repetitive processes. In one instance, one of the controllers failed and the replacement controller had to be built overseas since there weren’t any parts available so there was a possible downturn of four million dollars. And again, this is where your general skills come in, such as knowing what electronic components are and if they are damaged.
                            You learn to keep your good customers; you get rid of your bad customers when you can afford to stand up and pay your bills. Unfortunately, when you start up in business you have no choice, you have to take everything you can get until you get yourself established. I like to spend more and more time with my clients and with the help of some of my colleague’s management tools, it helps me free up some time; they serve a valuable part in my operations now. Also, as I’m quite senior in my life, a handover to my colleague will be quite easy as we’re using all of his tools to manage my clients. It’s always been a concern that if I’m no longer able to look after my clients anymore, what will happen to them if I’m taken ill? Will they be left to the sharks or is there some plan in place? Again, it all comes down to the collegiate groups, you pick up something, you find someone that’s doing similar things and then you start discussing how you can help each other, and you move on.

                        <h4 class="h2">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h4>
                        <p>
                        In the early years of doing cabling work, running cables was a no brainer, but it's what the cable does that always intrigued me i.e. “What does it transport?”. In the eighties and nineties, there was no google and your information was very hard to come by, other than libraries and bookstores. In terms of being a self-learner, it’s a really hard path. As the internet started to take shape, internet forums became available. One of my suppliers recommended that I seek out some discussion groups along with my pursuits and that’s where I started to communicate with similar minded people. I found that had I not done that; I would have fallen behind in terms of being able to increase my knowledge. You need to have some sort of ability to connect with people who know more than you do and are on a similar path of self-discovery and a desire for helping out people. Once I found a really good group, which was the small business user group in the late nineties, I never looked back. That evolved into a SMBIT group which is quite large today. Without the association, I would be quite isolated in a country town as I wouldn’t have the knowledge just by searching on my own. When you belong to an association you get far more exposure to cutting edge technology.
                        Quite often in country towns are a few years behind their city counterparts in terms of technology reaching them. You don’t have the ability to interact with the latest technology, because your customers aren’t interested, and you don’t have the finances to be able to buy yourself a 36 terabyte NAS drive and work with the storage and backups. I found by having an association with IT professionals, you make friends in the cyberworld and instances where you’re getting a job and having to walk into an unknown area or breaking something without being fully aware of what you’ve done, you still got this collegiate group of people that you can contact and they’ll help you out of a possible mess you’ve made or give you advice on what you should provide to the customer. If you don’t have that collegiate group you’re really on your own island, you need people that can provide you support in a professional way. I was fortunate enough to meet someone that was providing some IT services in my area and we were both members of the IT professionals organisation. Now we work together, where he has a larger client base, has all the remote management tools and experience in knowing how to improve my services towards my clients. It’s been really positive having that opportunity to know someone that I ordinarily wouldn’t ever meet. I would just be this little person in a country town not understanding any new technology or knowing what to look for. Just by sitting back and reading discussions amongst professionals, occasionally there will be something that’s discussed that’s right up your alley, it’s worth belonging to an organisation just for this reason.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h2">What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h4>
                        <p>
                        Interactions with my customers is a very personal one, that’s due to just being in a country town. The relationship is sincere, it has to be one hundred percent honest that I provide them with the best knowledge that I have and inform them that I don’t have the leading edge on items, but I can still offer a few pathways to choose from as we’re meeting all the new changes. That happens in all sorts of industries whether it’s the tourist industry, individuals or community groups that I volunteer, so it’s important that you have some stake where you provide your services back into the community for organisations in need of IT services that can’t afford to pay the larger companies.
                        I don’t see myself as a salesperson although IT can sometimes be a perfect opportunity for salespeople to move into. I see myself more as a friend and a provider of knowledge to equip a business to run successfully. What makes me fairly unique is that I come from a background with a number of trades and experiences in quite a number of areas. When I interact with my clients, I’ll often have an experience I can relate to and that takes me down a path of showing an interest in my clients and honesty that I understand what they’re doing in order to provide the correct IT advice for their future development. Whilst I moved into a lot of remote support work for my clients, I still feel it is essential that I make contact with as many people I can, whether it’s the CEO right down to the worker in the factory. I try and maintain contact and friendships inside the business, allowing me to get an idea of whether the company seems to be operating smoothly. Because quite often if that’s not done, you’ll find some worker’s IT equipment not functioning correctly and it’s left unaddressed. By the time you’re made aware of the issue, it’s blown up and caused anxiety amongst a number of people. So that’s why you get friendly with as many staff as you can and treat the situation as if you’re a part of the business and that they’re free to contact you when there’s an issue, unlike a managed service agreement or an impersonalised ticket which my colleague has in place. He has about ten times more clients than I have, he just cannot provide that personal touch. Yes, it’s all part of business as that’s the way he operates, but I didn’t want to go down that path. I just cannot see myself taking more customers and having less time to interact with the shop floor. That’s just how I wanted it, I don’t believe that in order to be a successful business you have to constantly expand and make more profit. There’s a sustainable way of operating an IT business and that’s a part of my belief that I always held; I wouldn’t expect someone to do something that I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself. That can also work the other way round as my customers can see how I operate, I’m happy to not run in this headlong ‘success is by excess’ mentality. They can see that I’m not taking them down a black hole of thousands of dollars each time I have an idea. The idea is to provide them with working technology that’s fit for purpose, not technology that’s not required and is just part of a profit-making operation.

                        <p>
                            Quite often you’re not going to work with modern equipment where everything has spare parts with twenty-four seven productions running smoothly because you have stock of every single fallible item. It just doesn’t happen in the real world ever. People just rely on the infrastructure to work and when it fails, when you take action. Questions like “Well how did this happen?” and “Why didn’t we have a backup or a spare part?” leads to changes in the pattern of how IT is thought of in the industry. In some instances, machinery built thirty to fifty years ago is still present in the industry, that’s where your knowledge has to come in. There’s no retrofitting of some machinery, so often you’ll either have to fix it or replace it totally and that’s a huge investment for the company. For an IT professional, if you have really good general skills, you’ll make yourself valuable in the business sector. In country towns like this word gets around pretty quickly that some have saved a company millions of dollars from a disaster, so it’s a great asset to have.

                        <p>
                            The things I find most challenging in the IT world is balancing family and your personal life with workload demands. That’s always been a difficult thing to do in terms of not knowing when there’s a failure from a managed monitoring system, not knowing when you have to suddenly leave home and have to go on site. There’s also a concern about all the changes in the IT world and threats security. Trying to stay one step ahead of hackers, having to understand the law in terms of cyber breaches. There are all these challenges that are constantly running in the background, whether it be working on your ability to try and find time to shut everything out or have some personal space is almost impossible. There’s no way out of this system because you can’t control what happens in cyberspace, it’s moving and you’ve got to move with it, there’s very little breathing space. The other challenge is running a business and getting your invoices out to stay afloat. You need to also have in mind how you want your business to evolve and ensure you are successful in keeping your clients functioning with the right balance of IT equipment. You also need to look at your own strengths and weaknesses and watch out for threats that might come upon you, whether it’s your health or a fire breaks out. You also need to have a contingency and backup plan to ensure you’ve prepared something for yourself.

                        <h4 class="h2">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
                        <p>
                            My clients are so varied, I really haven’t got one example that fits. All I can do is talk about one client that would give you an insight into the challenges I had to meet. It was a local steel merchant around ten years ago who was a part of a strong Christian community and initially needed some IT support. Their IT knowledge was very limited, they were very wary of the potential influence technology could impact on their community. There was a point where they had to move a paper-based operation into an electronic operation. The challenge there was to gain their trust, respect their beliefs and ensure that I would protect them as best I could from outside world influences and ensure that they were protected from the online world that they were connecting to. That meant finding a suitable software program that would manage their accounting and manufacturing, and research what was available gave good support and had similar values that I had in terms of respecting this religious group and also work closely with the owners in customising the program to suit their needs. These people only recently used mobile phones, so it was a real challenge to get them up to speed in terms of being able to operate a business in an electronic form away from ledgers. Over the years, they’ve gained an understanding of IT architecture, such as servers, switches, networking, and are now rolling out security camera systems for their organisation, even to the ever-changing threat from the cyberworld and having to take them through the ten years of evolving technology. They’ve adapted quite well and that’s basically where I’ve learned a lot of my skills in being able to follow a client through from the start like that. It requires a whole range of patience and slow steps with a long-term vision. Most other clients didn’t have that setback, so working with this client really needed some thinking outside the box on how you’re going to take a client into the digital world in a safe and respectful way so that they can be successful in a world that is all changing electronically.

                    The project idea is to create a ‘fitness’ application based on Australia for mobile devices that excels with a combination of sports, food and blog.
                    <Br> <b class="ppb">Sports -</b> The idea is to bring out a healthy and traditional way of being fit for the users for which the application consist of information
                    such as availability of the nearby grounds / players according to the user’s preferred location for them to engage in several sports
                    and also consist of various exercises to be followed.<Br> <b class="ppb">Food - </b>In this part consists various recipes to make at home, different diet plans,
                    and has an interesting option for the users to choose from the displayed food options which is awarded as healthy and tasty recipes and connects them to the
                    respective restaurants unlike other fitness application and also allow the users to make orders with the restaurant which will be kept prepared for the users
                    to take-away or the users can directly refer to the restaurant and visit them in person to dine-in directly by easing up the process for those people who tends
                    to hesitate to cook at home sometimes and still wants to keep up with the healthy meal plan, which would serve as a motivation and as well as help the users to
                    adopt a healthy life-style.<Br> <b class="ppb"> Blog - </b>This serves the main purpose of making the users want to use our

                        Doing regular exercise is essential for everyone under normal circumstances as it helps people live a longer, healthier and a happy life.
                        Although, it is these times like covid-19 makes it not possible for people at any age considering that they workout almost everyday or
                        even barely, who might even find it difficult to follow a proper diet plan due to the frustration, depression or even because of the time
                        they spend mostly at home in-order to stop the spread of covid-19 making it easy to forget the daily routine and leading to stress-eat,
                        that can be caused because of the lockdown implemented with concern to the pandemic. The government of Australia suggests that it is
                        important to stay active in-order to reduce the risk of health conditions like stroke and heart disease, to control gaining more weight,
                        to reduce stress and anxiety caused by this pandemic, and to improve sleep.
                        This application not only provides benefit during the normal times by helping in boosting up the immune system which might be of a great
                        help to an individual to help prepare their body to fight against any virus leading them to fall sick, but also during such difficult
                        times like covid-19 where one doesn’t want to go to gym, health clubs or fitness centres physically but just use our application instead
                        which gives them the strength to be kept motivated. One of the other main reasons to implement a fitness application is the statistics
                        below showing the projected growth of users using fitness applications from 2017 to 2022 which is to be increased from 62.7 million to 87.4 million users.

                            As soon as the application is opened after installation, the users will have to go through the login process for which they’ll
                            have to create a new account using their phone/email and by agreeing to all our privacy terms. Whereas, the existing users can
                            just enter the app without facing any of these processes.

                        <p>
                            The user will be asked to enter their personal details such as name, age, purpose of wanting to use the application, current weight,
                            height and their ideal weight for the application to provide customised and personalised view for each and every individual.

                        <p>
                            The user then will be displayed with our main page, consisting of Four main buttons which includes,

                <h4 class"ph2">SPORTS :-</h4>
                <p>
                    For the sports section, there are two main parts: Firstly, a service which allows users to locate sporting grounds and players that are nearby.
                    Secondly, access to online training virtual coaches.
                </p>
                <h5 class="ph2">Nearby Grounds/Players</h5>
                <p>
                    The intended function of this service is to assist sporting enthusiasts in finding nearby sporting grounds or courts.
                    As modern smartphones have the necessary GPS capabilities to locate individuals and locations, the app can use this to
                    allow the user to verify if particular grounds or courts are currently vacant or occupied. It would also provide
                    detailed descriptions of sporting venues, by listing the types of courts, whether it is an indoor or outdoor venue,
                    opening hours, public transportation available nearby and contact information about the local club. Each user will
                    also have their own profile, allowing users to locate one another and for finding coaches for improving their skills.
                    The users profiles can also allow users to add each other as contacts where they can communicate with each other
                    using the chat feature mentioned below. Other features that are included in this program include: The latest sporting
                    news, the results of previous matches played both at the social level and professional level, tutorial videos about
                    learning how to play particular sports, as well as upcoming tournament and match fixtures.
                </p>
                <h5 class="ph2">Online Training via Virtual Coach</h5>
                <p>
                    The online training service is an implementation of a virtual video session with a specified coach for users looking
                    for training assistance, similar to video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. Coaches can then
                    provide feedback, perform demonstrations, motivate, and provide advice to the user during their routine, as they
                    would in person. Furthermore, users will be able to set appointments with trainers, with options to choose from
                    such as: Available times for coaches, the type of sport they are participating in or which workout routine they
                    are following, the specific virtual coach they want to work with and also choosing to keep in touch with their coaches via the chat feature.

                    items and much more including food for specific health problems. As the user selects a particular choice of recipe, they will be

                    according to their needs (gain muscle, lose weight etc..). The Diet Plan will combine the Healthy Recipe we provide and use the
                    recommended ingredients and relative recipes into the diet. The page of Diet Plan will be displayed in the form of calendar memo,
                    and the screen of each individual date will include the Diet Plan already made. Users are flexible to change their Diet Plan at

                    food of their choice and decide to either pick-up or dine-in. Based on the selected option, the application connects them to the
                    respective restaurants which will further lead to a process where the food is prepared and kept ready for pick or the customers
                    can simply order from the restaurant.
