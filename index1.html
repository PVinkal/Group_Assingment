                             I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia in 2016.

                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.
